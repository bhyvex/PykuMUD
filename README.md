PykuMUD
=======

A Python re-imagining of DikuMUD.

My goals for this project are simple.  First, I want to convert the content of my old DikuMUD into a new game driver, written in Python.  This will enable me to enjoy working on it again, as the micromanagement required for C code is just too annoying for a passtime.

Second, I want the gameplay and general "feel" of the game to be as close as possible to my old DikuMUD, at least from the player's perspective.  The actual implementation will be very different, but the game should have the same mechanics and functionality as the original C version.  Ideally, the player shouldn't be able to tell it's NOT the original.

Lastly, I would like to make this 100% originally coded, from the ground up.  If I can do so, it will be licensed under the BSD license to avoid the irritation of the original DikuMUD license.  However, I recognize that re-implementing has to be a complete re-write to avoid being a derivative work, and I may not have the time or patience to stick to that goal.  If any code is borrowed, or translated directly, the DikuMUD license will, of course, apply.
